# mode-connectivity
Code for our mode connectivity paper (Rohith Kuditipudi, Xiang Wang, et al. Explaining Landscape Connectivity of Low-cost Solutions for Multilayer Nets. NeurIPS 2019.). The MNIST experiments shown in the left, center, and right plots in Figure 2 can be replicated by running vary_keep_prob.py, interpolate.py and vary_width.py respectively.
